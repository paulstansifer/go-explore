You need GnuGo installed and somewhere on your path.

Up = undo.  Down = make GnuGo's move.  Click = make own move.

On my Mac, clicking on the program icon causes the game to crash.
Seems to be a pygame bug (not related to the frivolous icon updating),
so switch programs using command-tab or something instead.
